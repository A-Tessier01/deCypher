A POC for an application to assist individuals with Dyslexia.

The goal of this project is to develop an AR headset with eye tracking capabilities that can detect a block of text a user is looking at. 
The AR glasses will use open source TTS to dictate the text to the user, while the AR lens will overlay a highlight on each word as it is dictated to the user.

This tool will have virtually no friction for the user, allowing anyone to read at their listening pace.
